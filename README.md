# test-odom-5-7-July-2022


Today, I crerated eperated the multitasked code, which will run with the main code at the same time. Next, I tried one formular, which I use in my code.

- found and rewrite the code, which will convert my local X and Y to the global -> I wrote the mssage to the programmer of the code, and I found that the code doesnt work for distance units.


What I want to do:

- create the post on the vex forum for help 
- make the code working to find global X and Y position
